# libcst test

Trying out [LibCST](https://github.com/Instagram/LibCST) from Instagram.

My friend @m157q asking me if there's a way to programmably check
[Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask) web API signatures from given Python
source code. I heard LibCST from Instagram recently and would like to try it
out!
